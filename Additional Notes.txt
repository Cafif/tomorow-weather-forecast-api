Things to optimize / pitfalls in this application:

It seems that free DB providers plans have very strict limitations on insertion queries, therefore
uploading data to the service takes a lot of time.
This would not be such an issue in a real PROD deployment.

Although I've dealt with most common errors that can occur,
there are a few possible scenarios that will return general error messages where ideally I would want a more specific error.


Some things that are missing in order to make this service production-ready:

* Store credentials to the DB outside of the code - ENV variables / some other solution such as AWS Secrets..
* Add logs throughout the application and implement monitoring.
* Optimize insertion to the DB with specific bulk sizes.
* Restrict the upload endpoint to specific known senders/authenticated users (?) and possibly the get insights endpoint as well, depending on the use case.
* Implement more sophisticated error handling.
